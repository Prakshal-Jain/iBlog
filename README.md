# iBlog
An open-source, secure, deployment-ready & minimalistic blogging platform made with Django Framework!

One of the special features which adds on an extra layer of security is:
- Admin (owner) will receive an email for approval and proofreading once a post is published.
I am planning to deploy bots to proofread the content before it is published. Automating that task will make it more advanced!

If you want me to help with any of your projects, or need help in working on the frontend or backend functionality for this project, feel free to email me at: prakshal@buffalo.edu!

<h3>Setting Up the project</h3>
- Install all dependencies
- In the command line, run Virtual Environment by "pipenv shell"
- Open settings.py in iBlog/iBlog/settings.py
- Enter your Email address for *EMAIL_HOST_USER*
- Enter your Email Password address for *EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD*
- In the command line, run "python manage.py migrate"
- In the command line, run "python manage.py runserver"

Congrats! You are all set up!
